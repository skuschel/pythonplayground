# Python playground

Explore (new) possibilies in python. Its a collection of examples what can be done with python. Anything is welcome, as long it seves either demonstration or educational purposes:

* interfacing python with other (compiled or not) languages
* python structural things to demonstrate how descriptors, decorators, MRO, or whatever works
* examples of plotting of file IO
* Implementation of algorithms to make people understand how they work (i.e. from numerical recipes).
* use cases of one of the above points
* benchmarks comparing different implementations.
* ANYTHING!

Classes of similar topics (like interfacing python with C code) will be grouped into subfolders.
