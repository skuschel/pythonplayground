Try to meet as many of the following points as possible:

 * The example is a **single file**, that can directly be exectued
 * It runs **without any arguments**. Although optional arguements are fine to alter the example
 * During execution it writes **clear messages** making the point clear it demonstrates
 * It containes well **commented code** that is easy to understand

Its not always possible, so just try to get as close as you can. If your example consists of more than a single file, place everything inside a subfolder.
